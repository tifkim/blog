<p>This past weekend, I attended the <a href="http://madisonpl.us/ruby/">Madison+ Ruby</a> conference as a student volunteer. It was great to meet experienced Rubyists and hear their views on technology, the community or even guilty pleasure TV shows. :) An unexpected plus--I met 2 fellow Firehosers (@DavidSavatski and @ColinRubbert) who had plenty of advice since they've just wrapped up the program.</p>

<p><strong>My biggest takeaway is that I need to start going to meetups.</strong> I met a lot of other bootcamp students (mostly those who came out of the Chicago DevBootcamp), got industry perspective from people in the field, and received a lot of encouragement to start getting involved even if I'm still just learning my way around. I have to show up if I plan to be plugged into the local community and learn what's out there. I'm nervous to pair at this point because I still clutch to templates as I'm building, but you have to let go of the pool wall at some point to swim!</p>
<p>I was pretty impressed with the quality of this conference and the diversity it brought. It had a much more tight-knit feel than other conferences I've attended and it was an easy-going introduction to the larger Ruby community.</p>
<p>This event has been hosted the last 5 years, and this year, unfortunately, was the last. Luckily, the talks were streamed and can be accessed via Youtube. Here are just a few talks I'd recommend checking out.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Brief Firehose Update:</strong> I completed my first coding challenges last week and continue to work on improving my sense of OOP. Between that and racking my brain on the next coding challenge, I continue to work on my Nomster Yelp clone project. I'm not as far along as I'd hope due to life events (being away on the conference, getting ready for a new job I'll start in a month, allergies running havoc the last week) but I think I'm making decent progress and I felt pretty good about how much I was able to follow the technical talks at the conference. More updates to come!</p>
