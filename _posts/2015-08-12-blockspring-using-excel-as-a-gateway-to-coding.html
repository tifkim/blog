<p>I geek over Excel. There's a unique happiness you experience when you're able to utilize a functionality that saves you hours of analysis or simply organize layers of information. Sometimes my urge to put everything into a spreadsheet can border on the compulsive side, and I really have to make myself back away before running off to create a new dashboard. But this is my cross to bear.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, I came across an interesting article from <em>Wired</em> about this<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/blockspring/"> new Excel product that gets non-techies to code</a>. The plugin works with Excel or google spreadsheets and essentially a series of APIs that allow you to pull/work with data in a user-friendly fashion. I was impressed with the array of apps that Blockspring already integrated with (Twitter, Instagram, AngelList, LinkedIn, search engines, see more <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/browse">here</a>). Something I'd be interested to do is query the job listings on AngelList to see what qualities are most sought after in technical candidates. I'll have to remind myself to post the findings if I get it to work.</p>
