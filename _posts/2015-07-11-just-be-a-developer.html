<p>One of my favorite books by far is Kevin Smith's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tough-Sh-Life-Advice-Lazy/dp/1592407447/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436551597&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kevin+smith+tough+shit">Tough Sh*t: Life Advice from a Fat Lazy Slob Who Did Good</a>. I highly recommend the audiobook, because I'm a huge fan of books read by the original author, and Kevin's crass, honest wit is just awesome. (If you end up liking this book as much as I did, check out the Smodcast podcasts.)</p>
<p>There are a hundred quotable blurbs from that book, but the one that resonates with me right now is where he recounts some advice he got from his sister early in his filmmaking journey.</p>
<blockquote><p>"'I want to be a filmmaker. I would say that for a few weeks until my sister Virginia gave me some awesome advice, 'Then be a filmmaker.' 'That's the idea," I said, 'I wanna be a filmmaker.' '<strong>You don't have to wanna be a filmmaker, just be a filmmaker,</strong>' Virginia said. 'Every thought you have, think it as a filmmaker. You're already a filmmaker, you just haven't made a film yet.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>The initial self-doubt he was going through sounds like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a> and similar to how I feel about trying to break into coding. Specifically, what right do I have to say that I want to be a developer when I don't even know if I have the chops for it?</p>
<p>Then there's my little cousin Max telling me <strong>"you can't go into something thinking you're going to lose because you're going to lose"</strong> (in reference to <em>Call of Duty</em> but applies here nonetheless). Pretty wise for anybody to say, let alone an elementary schooler.</p>
<p>There have been tougher odds. Kevin Smith was some dude working at a convenience store in Jersey, no resources and no connections, who bank-rolled his directorial debut and went onto be an indie mogul. And I am learning to code. :)</p>
