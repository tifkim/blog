<p><a href="https://tifkim.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_1652.jpg"><img class="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_1652.jpg" alt="My workspace at the Barnes &amp; Noble Cafe" width="160" height="160" align="left" hspace="20" /></a>Fueled with a caramel macchiato and Motown playlist, I'm camped out at the local Barnes and Noble continuing to inch through this coding odyssey. I just completed <strong>the Firehose Project 2-week prework challenges</strong> to get a feel for the program. I've always thought a huge plus of this program in particular was the team project component, so I'm excited to get started. I can't help but continue to window-shop programs because there are so many options, but I keep coming back to this one so I think I'll enroll when I come back from Hong Kong later this month.</p>
<p>I'd also love to take a design class eventually. I keep getting distracted by how amateurish my projects look. Part of it is probably me being obsessive but I also think there's credence to the power of perception. At my previous position, the presentation of my work was almost as important as the solutions I was presenting clients in terms of how they would value my work.</p>
<p>For now, I'm continuing to work through Treehouse and Free Code Camp. I'm really anxious to move through the latter to see what nonprofit projects I might be able to work on. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/can-real-world-work-free-coding-boot-camp/">WIRED featured Free Code Camp in this article</a> I came across a few weeks ago, which is when I decided to try it out. Pretty good stuff so far. It's really incredible how alternative coding education has emerged. I wonder if this is something I would have taken advantage of in college, but it might have taken some overwhelming life experiences to jerk me in this new direction I've taken. Carpe diem. :)</p>
