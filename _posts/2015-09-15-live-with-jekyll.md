I migrated my blog to Jekyll today! It seemed like a worthwhile side project as I was working on installing my other projects. Then I read more about the benefits (faster query, more secure because of the database-less structure) and was sold. I was pleasantly surprised to find the many websites that leverage this tool, including HealthGov.org. The one downside thus far is that my spelling is really being tested since I'm now posting through text editors. :)

Now that I have the bones, I'll gradually pretty this up and likely follow up with a summary of the steps I took.
