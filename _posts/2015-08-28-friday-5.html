<p>Five random things I found helpful or interesting this week.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>TED Talk About Motivation:</strong> Dan Ariely speaks on <a href="https://youtu.be/5aH2Ppjpcho">"What makes us feel good about our work?"</a>. Spoiler: The answer is creating purpose. Not totally surprising, but heÂ has some compelling case studies.</li>
<li><strong>Quote:</strong> A team is not a group of people who work together. A team is a group of people who trust each other. - Simon Sinek</li>
<li><strong>PIT Manuever</strong>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIT_maneuver">precision immobilization technique</a>, is a method to force fleeing vehicles to an abrupt stop by turning them sideways and causing the driver to lose control. The physics of this intrigued me after watching an episode of <em>&lt;/Scorpion&gt;</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity: Pomodoro Technique</strong> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730">more info on LifeHacker</a>)<br />
I'm currently using the Pomodoro Time app on my Macbook. Trying to get this to be more of a native habit for me because it feels pretty effective when I do get around to using it.</li>
<li><strong>Documentary: <em>Tig</em></strong>. I have the utmost respect for standup comedians who entertain large audiences with nothing but their observations and how they share their life experiences. Tig Notaro took an unbelievably dark moment in her life and took control.</li>
</ol>
