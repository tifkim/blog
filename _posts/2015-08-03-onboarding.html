<p>Hizzah! I have an environment set up. Finally taking the steps to get my feet wet after months of dabbling with tutorials and self-learning tools.</p>
<p>I had my onboarding session with one of the instructors, and I'm excited to get my first web-app up soon! My goal to get that done is Friday, and I'm sure I'll have more to tell as the week goes on.</p>
