<p>Five things I found helpful or interesting this week.</p>
<h2>1. Things to check before publishing your website [<a href="http://www.onextrapixel.com/2015/09/02/15-things-to-check-before-launching-a-new-website/">Treehouse Blog</a>]</h2>
<p>I'm working on a film portfolio website for my brother. Some things on the list feel like a given but I like that it's comprehensive.</p>
<h2>2. Startup Monikers for Different Cities in the U.S.</h2>
<p>A college friend posted an interesting question on his blog, <a href="http://codeofcomedy.com/2015/09/question-whats-the-tech-scene-like-in-your-city/">Code of Comedy</a>. He discussed what the startup environment was like in his native New York / Silicon Alley and wondered if other cities had fun nicknames. While I've been growing familiar with the local startup landscape, I didn't know if Wisconsin went by a startup moniker as well. After a few minutes of internet research, I had my answer-- <em>Silicon Prairie</em> or <em>Sili-corn Valley </em>[<a href="http://ow.ly/RHmXz">ref</a>]. I made a face when I read the latter but its humor has grown on me!</p>
<h2>3. Gaming Music for Your Work Soundtrack</h2>
<p>Going back to being a full-time student has been an adjustment. When you have a job, you can use some downtime to go through administrative tasks to mix it up a bit. However, most of what I'm doing now is still new to me and requires a high cognitive load, so my work stamina is lower than what I'm used to.</p>
<p>In my continued search to improve productivity/concentration I came across an interesting article that suggests listening to video game soundtracks while you work [<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3030502/agendas/the-new-playlist-for-more-productive-work-video-game-soundtracks">FastCompany</a>]. The more I think about it, it makes sense because this type of music is designed to keep players pulsing while they are processing information and executing fine motor skill tasks.</p>
<h2>4. How to Be Amazing - Episode 11 with Nate Silver</h2>
<p>Hosted by comedian Ian Black, this episode is an easy-going interview with the most high-profile data celebrity of our generation. The rest of the series is really enjoyable as well. [<a href="http://howtobeamazingshow.com/">Podcast found here</a>]</p>
<h2>5. Quote: How you do anything is how you do everything.</h2>
<p>It's difficult to source this quote because it's been said by so many people but so true. Sometimes, it helps to hear something that gives you a small smack to get yourself together!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>And Friday posts wouldn't be complete without a <strong>FirehoseProject update</strong>...</p>
<p>Week 5 really flew by because I had a lot of curriculum I wanted to get through. I was able to finish <a href="http://chowscout.herokuapp.com/">my Yelp clone</a> (finally!) and work through the test-driven development exercises to free up some time to experiment on side projects or refine my existing apps.</p>
<p>I feel good about where I am with the assignments but the code challenges are making me realize my lack of object understanding when it comes to the Ruby end of things, so this has shifted my focus for the upcoming week.</p>
