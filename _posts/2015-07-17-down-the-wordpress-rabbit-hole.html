<p>I was extremely naive to what Wordpress could do. I knew it was a powerful platform given the prevalence of websites I see leveraging this system. I'm trying to teach myself this, but even with the assistance of Treehouse Academy and other tutorials, it can be an overwhelming maze! I wish there was a <strong>10,000ft infographic</strong> that could tell me what the impact of these functionalities are on the architecture/design of the finished product.</p>
<p>Maybe I was overthinking this, but <strong>I was pondering for the better part of an hour whether I truly needed a post type or could get by with categories/tags</strong>. Aiiya.</p>
<p>I found a few things that helped, like this <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/when-do-you-need-a-custom-post-type-or-taxonomy-in-wordpress/">WP Beginner article</a>. My compulsive curiosity is sated to the point where I can start experimenting with these tools without being distracted by confusion, but I don't think I'll have a strong grasp until I have a running website.</p>
