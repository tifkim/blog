<p>If you aren't familiar with Stephen Covey's "big rocks" demonstration, <a href="http://www.scc.k12.wi.us/District/Big_Rocks_Stephen_Covey.pdf">check this out</a> before reading this post. It's a well-worth read.</p>
<p>Essentially, I was reminded of the need to set clear priorities today when my day slipped by taking care of a bunch of tiny tasks. I did not get as far in my studies as I would have hoped but trying to turn around this guilt to fuel for tomorrow to correct my course.</p>
