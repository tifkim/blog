<p>I had a goal to read at least 20 books this year, which sounds low to me, but when I think about it, much of my reading has been replaced with online articles and tutorials. I have a few that I've already scratched off with some thoughts/recommendations. The rest, I'll try to knock out while I'm traveling and report with my thoughts at the end of the month. I'm counting audiobooks into this mix.</p>
<ol>
<li>Delivering Happiness by Tony Hsieh - Interesting/intimidating ideologies. I could see a lot of echoed ideas with the philosophies of the last company I worked for so kind of eerie...</li>
<li>The Virgin Way by Richard Branson</li>
<li>Yes, Please! by Amy Poehler</li>
<li>Shark Tales by Barbara Corcoran</li>
<li>The Circle by Dave Eggers</li>
<li>Modern Love by Aziz Ansari</li>
<li><strong>The $100 Startup</strong></li>
<li><strong>Personal MBA</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Lean Startup</strong></li>
</ol>
