<p>I was picking up my husband from work yesterday, and on my way there, I could see that the ride back home on our usual route would be miserable. There were cars lined up as far as the eye could see on this half-mile stretch to leave the office.</p>

<p>The solution was simple. After he got in the car, we took a scenic route behind the office buildings that goes past a few community plots and farmland. This route is easily twice the distance but we still managed to get back within a reasonable amount of time and probably a little faster than if we'd sat in that line. Most importantly, we avoided the aggravating wait full of potholes and car-jerking to inch toward the exit.</p>

<p>This, in itself, was just a small win on a regular day but it reminded me of something bigger I had just read about. In <strong>Laura Vanderkam's book <em>I Know How She Does It</em>,</strong> she discusses how negative incidences can drastically impact your perception of how many hours you work. The top professionals she worked with in her surveys documented working over 60 hours a week; however, when their activity logs were further inspected, they had actually worked closer to 30-40 hours. It's the anxiety, annoyances, and grievances that can really inflate your perceived amount of work.</p>
<p>This made me think a lot about why I might have been unhappy at my previous job. I think there were things that were both in and out of my control that made me feel overworked, and I'm still trying to better understand what those factors were so I don't repeat my mistakes. For the moment, I'm glad to take a break from that line of cars and enjoy the view.</p>
