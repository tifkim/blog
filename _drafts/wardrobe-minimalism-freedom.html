<p>I've been studying a lot from home lately, more so since I got my wisdom teeth removed last week. So when I was getting ready to actually head outside the other day, I wasn't used to how long it was taking me to pick out an outfit. #firstworldproblems</p>
<p>Reducing my closet has been something that's long been on my to do list ever since I came across <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/10/05/steve-jobs-always-dressed-exactly-the-same-heres-who-else-does/">articles like this one from Forbes</a> describing how successful people like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and even President Obama purposely wear the same thing every day.<img class=" aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/zucker-800x400.jpg" alt="Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg in their iconic neutral outfits" width="352" height="176" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:9px;">Image Taken from <a href="http://elitedaily.com/money/science-simplicity-successful-people-wear-thing-every-day/849141/">EliteDaily</a></p>
<p>There are obvious benefits--saving time in the mornings, avoiding stress and decision fatigue (<a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/wear-one/">8 Reasons Successful People are Choosing to Wear the Same Thing Every Day</a>). But another benefit that I hadn't thought of before is <strong>consistently looking put-together</strong>. <em>Doug Funnie always did look great in his green sweater vest!</em></p>
<p>Shopping for clothes can also get out of hand. It's reported that <strong>women wear an item of clothing on average 7 times before discarding it</strong> to avoid being seen in the same outfits (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3116962/Throwaway-fashion-Women-adopted-wear-culture-binning-clothes-wears-aren-t-pictured-outfit-twice-social-media.html">DailyMail</a>), but how many of us have items of clothing we've hardly even worn after buying?<em> I'll raise my hand to this one.</em></p>
<p>This morning, I took the first step by grabbing more than half the clothes I own and sorting them for Ebay. I'll have to get back to these when I return from traveling, but I'm hoping that once everything's done, I'll have a little pocket change and a lot of relief knowing I'll have less to pack next time we move!</p>
