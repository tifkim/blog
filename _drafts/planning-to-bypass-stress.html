<p>I was listening to Staying Productive While Staying Stress-Free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A life best lived is a life by design. Not by accident, and not by just walking through the day careening from wall to wall and managing to survive. That's okay. But if you can start giving your life dimensions and design and color and objectives and purpose, the results can be staggering.</p></blockquote>
