<p>The last time I wrote about theFirehose Project was when I was just onboarded. A few things have happened since then so I wanted to start a more regular progress report.</p>
<p>Progress/Small Victories</p>
<ul>
<li>I completed a simple quote generator web app and am still working on my Yelp clone food app.</li>
<li>I worked through some object oriented programming materials and started working on some coding challenges.</li>
<li>Went back to an earlier exercises and I was able to create a solution right away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lessons Learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Especially in the beginning, read the error message word for word.</li>
<li>Think about why something might be important but write your questions down and go back to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>And today, I'm at a local Ruby confererence, Madison+ Ruby. I'm here as a volunteer but still able to attend quite a few of the talks. It's run primarily by this local dev firm, . I'm meeting tons of students from dev bootcamp, which is a pleasant surprise.</p>
